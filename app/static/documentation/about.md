Documentation notes
---
Anyone can add documentation by making a Google Doc!

Advantages:

- Once documentation is published, it can continue to be edited via the google doc
	- these edits are automatically republished
- Don't need to know HTML or anything about the inner workings of the app to write documentation

How it works:

- I have a JSON file mapping ```{document-name: url for the iframe} ```
- All that needs to happen to get to that document under /documentation/document-name is for Alex or someone to update that JSON file
